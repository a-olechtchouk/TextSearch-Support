# TextSearch-Support

# Choosing files and directories
Click the "Select files or directories" button to open the file importer, allowing you to choose multiple files or directories to search.

# Search
With files or directories selected, enter text that you want to search for in the searchbar. Press "Enter" to begin the search.

# Viewing matching lines
Once a search is complete, files containing lines that match the search criteria are displayed in 2 places:
1. The sidebar view. This shows the filename and the number of line matches within that file. Clicking on a filename will show only that file in the detail view. Press "Escape" to unselect the file.
2. The detail view. This shows all information for all files that match the search criteria. Each line that matches the search is displayed, along with the file modification date and the full path of the file. Left-clicking on the full path will open that file in the Finder, and right-clicking will show additional options, such as the ability to copy the filepath to the clipboard. Each matching line displays the line number in which the match occurred. The searched text is highlighted in red within the matching line. Additionally, you can sort the order in which files are displayed.

# Filtering files
Underneath the searchbar in the sidebar view, you can enter text in the filter field and press "Enter" to filter specific filenames from the resulting search.

# Settings
Click the "gear" button to view app settings, where you can change various search settings.
